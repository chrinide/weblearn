# WebLearn

This is a proof of concept to create a very simple component to serve
scikit-learn machine learning models over HTTP. The idea is to use this
component as a micro-service inside a more complex infrastructure.

It's based on Flask because it's lightweight, easy to use and fairly well
documented.
